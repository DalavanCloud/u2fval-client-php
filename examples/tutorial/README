== U2FVAL Tutorial
This tutorial will show an example of how to add U2F capability to an existing
username/password based site. To follow along, start by cloning the repository
and checking out the first tutorial git tag: tutorial-1. At each step check out
the contents of this README and take a look at the source code changes from the
previous step by running:

  git diff HEAD~1

Once ready, move on to the next step:

  git checkout tutorial-N

...where N is replaced by the step number, 1-5.

=== Requirements
You will need to have installed the u2fval-client-php library as described in
the main README. You will also need a web server with PHP support, accessible
using a real domain name. You can use the hosts file for this. The reason this
is needed is that the browser won't allow U2F actions performed on an invalid
Application ID. Lastly, you will need to set up an application on a U2FVAL
server with the proper AppID, and enter those credentials in the config.php
file in the examples directory.

=== Starting point
To start out, there is a basic site which accepts username and password for
authentication. You can try it out by going to index.php. The usernames and
passwords are hardcoded. The starting point for the site is index.php, which
provides a form for logging in, taking a username and password. These are sent
to authenticate.php which validate them, and if successful, forwards the user
to welcome.php. Try it out for yourself, then move on to the next step:

  git checkout tutorial-2
