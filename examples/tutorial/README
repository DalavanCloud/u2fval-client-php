== U2FVAL Tutorial
This tutorial will show an example of how to add U2F capability to an existing
username/password based site. To follow along, start by cloning the repository
and checking out the first tutorial git tag: tutorial-1. At each step check out
the contents of this README and take a look at the source code changes from the
previous step by running:

  git diff HEAD~1

Once ready, move on to the next step:

  git checkout tutorial-N

...where N is replaced by the step number, 1-5.
